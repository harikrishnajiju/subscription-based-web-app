# subscription-based-web-app
Imagine a product like Amazon Prime/Netflix - They have lots of users and they need to provide subscriptions(monthly/yearly) for their customers. So, this app implements a subscription based billing module for a software product like the one aforementioned using Stripe. It has user register/login functionalities along with purchase/modfy/cancel subscription modules.
